## Suggestions for Improving This Assignment

To make this assignment even better, I think it would help to clarify the instructions, especially around how errors should be handled and what the expected output should look like. Adding some edge cases, like updating the same key multiple times in a transaction or handling unsupported nested transactions, could make the testing more thorough. Including examples in Python would also make it more approachable for students who might not be comfortable with Java. Finally, it might be helpful to ask students to reflect on their design choices and challenges they facedâ€”this could make the assignment more meaningful and engaging. These changes would make the assignment more accessible and valuable for everyone involved.
